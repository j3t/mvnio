`mvnio` is a horizontal scalable Maven Repository Manager with first class support for S3 buckets. 

The underlying webserver is implemented with [reactive streams](https://www.reactive-streams.org/), or more specific by using [Spring webflux](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/web-reactive.html#webflux) which uses [project-reactor](https://projectreactor.io/) under the hood. For the S3 bucket interaction, the [Amazon Async S3 client library](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v2/developer-guide/basics-async.html) is used, which is also a non-blocking API, and it has support for other S3 compatible storage providers as well (e.g. `MinIO`).

# Motivation
There are plenty of [Maven Repository Managers](https://maven.apache.org/repository-management.html#available-repository-managers) and they are great and have a lot of features, but most of them don't support S3 buckets at all or not very well or require a special license.

As alternative, you could use a so called maven-wagon which basically adds S3 bucket support to the maven client. There are also plenty of them ([1](https://github.com/gkatzioura/CloudStorageMaven), [2](https://github.com/jcaddel/maven-s3-wagon), [3](https://github.com/seahen/maven-s3-wagon), ...), but they require an extra configuration, which in fact often is not supported by third-party products. For example Jenkins picks not up the extra configuration (see https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-30058). They also cannot take into account that `Maven artifacts are immutable`. You could lock the objects in S3 but then the metadata cannot be updated anymore.

# Features
* [Standard Repository Layout](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MAVENOLD/Repository+Layout+-+Final)
* upload and download artifacts
* browse artifacts and retrieve metadata easily
* stateless and horizontal scalable
* support for any S3 compatible storage provider
* multiple repositories
* immutability protection
* quick startup time and less memory consumption

# How it Works
The diagram below shows how `mvnio` handles maven client requests and how they are mapped to the S3 storage provider.

![Architecture](https://puml.jtlab.de/png/ootBKz2rKyWjoylCLx1IS7SDKSWlKWW83Od9qyzDB4lDqwykIYt8ByuioI-ghDMlJYmgoKnBJ2wfvO9e0UeDDWPfJ2tnJyfAJIu1Qo-5ScBoaagJirDBR94DqL78JgsqHJ89Q03C2GXJWGm0)

In general, a maven client interacts with a maven repository when it tries to `install` an artifact with a `GET` request and with a `PUT` request when it wants to `deploy` an artifact. For example, when a client requests `GET /maven/releases/foo/bar/1.0.1/bar-1.0.1.pom` from `mvnio` then `mvnio` tries to get an object with key `foo/bar/1.0.1/bar-1.0.1.pom` in bucket `releases` from `S3`.

The [AppTests](src/test/java/com/github/j3t/mvnio/AppTests.java) and the corresponding [requests and responses](docs/app-tests) could also be helpful if you want more details.

# Configuration
[AppProperties](src/main/java/com/github/j3t/mvnio/AppProperties.java) contains a list of all available configuration parameters, and their default values.  

# Security
`mvnio` expects a `Basic Authorization` Header sent along with any client request. The header contains the S3 Credentials of the corresponding S3 Bucket. It also requires the following permissions:

* `s3:GetObject` - to download artifacts
* `s3:HeadObject` and `s3:PutObject` - to upload artifacts
* `s3:ListBucket`- to request metadata or to list versions (optional)

Note: ***Clients can bypass the repository and modify artifacts in S3 directly!***

# Getting started
This example shows how `mvnio` can be set up with [MinIO](https://min.io/) as storage provider. It requires `docker-compose` and `mvn` installed properly and, for sake of simplicity, the MinIO admin user will be used to connect to S3/MinIO. For production environments you should use an extra user with strong credentials, and the minimum required permissions (see [Security](#security))!

Let's get started:
* run `docker-compose up` to start up `mvnio` and `MinIO` as well (ports: 8080 and 9000)
* run `docker-compose run --rm mc config host add minio http://minio:9000 admin long-password` once to register MinIO
* run `docker-compose run --rm mc mb minio/releases` to create a bucket named `releases`
* adjust your `~/.m2/settings.xml`:
```
<settings xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0"
          xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
          xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/settings-1.0.0.xsd">
  <servers>
    <server>
      <id>maven-releases</id>
      <username>admin</username>
      <password>long-password</password>
    </server>
  </servers>
</settings>
```
* create a file named `pom.xml` in an empty directory with the following content:
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"
         xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
         xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">
    <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>

    <groupId>foo</groupId>
    <artifactId>bar</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.1</version>

    <distributionManagement>
        <repository>
            <id>maven-releases</id>
            <url>http://localhost:8080/maven/releases</url>
        </repository>
    </distributionManagement>
</project>
```
* run `mvn deploy`
```

The artifacts should now be available in `MinIO`.
* open http://localhost:9000 in your browser (accessKey: `admin`, secretKey: `long-password`)

# Roadmap
* mirror for central (light version, just proxy the request)
* alternative user/account management
    * independent of S3
    * central configuration (via `vault` for example)
    * storage provider is configurable per repository
    * proxy/mirror for repositories (central and external)

# Pitfalls
* users accessKey/secretKey in S3, are used as username/password in Maven (see `~/.m2/settings.xml`)
* users can bypass the repository and access objects directly in S3
